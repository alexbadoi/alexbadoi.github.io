I am a senior consultant in the Analytics & Cognitive team for Deloitte Dublin. During my professional career I've been working within the wider Fin-Tech space building technical and data manipulation skills needed to undertake a wide variety of data management, quantitative and machine learning tasks. 

I completed MSc Financial Economics and a Prof. Diploma in Data Analytics from top european universities. I now spend a considerable amount of my free time to developing financial trading backtesting and startegy optimization tools.
